From the experimental results in this paper, several conclusions can be drawn.
%

Firstly, from experimental investigation on the working mechanism, it can be seen that our proposal is able to relieve the premature convergency to several optimization levels.
%
Secondly, our proposal is able to enhance the perforamence of DE algorithms, in particular when the search space is large.
%
Third, it is also less sensitive to the parameter of population size, so our proposal can also be competitive even if the population size is small.
%

For future work of this papes, two intersting issues should be addressed for out proposal.
%
The first one is that explored areas in the search space should be avoided to save computing resources.
%
Applying our proposal to real-world problems is also an interesting topic.
%
Development a strategy of adaptive distance factor.
%
Based in several analyzes the mutation factor could be selected inside the distance factor.
