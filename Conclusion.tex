Based in the experimental results carried out in this work, the next conclusions can be drawn.
%
Principally, the premature convergence can be treated adequately through an advanced replacement phase and considering an elite population.
%
Also, our proposal is able to enhance the performance of the state-of-the-art, as well the standard-DE in long-term executions.
%
Additionally, the \DEEDM{} only requires the population size and the initial distance factor, 
which is considered an advantage since that several recient algorithms are over-parameterized.
%
Finally, differently to the \DE{} algorithms, our proposal is not extremely affected by small population sizes.


Several extesions could be explored as alternateive or to further improve our proposal, the most important are described as follows.
%
Firstly, some strategies that involves the expensive optimization field should be analysed, thus several functions evaluations could be avoided to save resources.
%
Additionally, a self-adaptive scheme of the initial distance factor should be develop to provide a stable behavior.
%
Aslo, to explore the possibility of involve a local search scheme. 
%
Thus, the irregular fitness landscapes could be solved adequately (e.g. multi-modal problems).
%
Applying our proposal to real-world problems could provide high quality solutions (e.g. deal with combinatorial problems).
%
Generate a theoretical model to select the adequately population size given a initial distance factor.
%
Finally, implement the replacement procedure to the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms seems a promising field.
