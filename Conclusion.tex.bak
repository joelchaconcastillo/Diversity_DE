From the experimental results in this paper, several conclusions can be drawn.
%

Firstly, from experimental investigation on the working mechanism, it can be seen that our proposal is able to relieve the premature convergency to several optimization levels.
%
Secondly, our proposal is able to enhance the perforamence of DE algorithms, in particular when the search space is large.
%
Third, it is also less sensitive to the parameter of population size, so our proposal can also be competitive even if the population size is small.
%
Fourth, it seems that our proposal has some drawback in relation with the proportion of difference vectors.


For future work of this paper, two intersting issues should be addressed for our proposal.
%
The first one is that explored areas in the search space should be avoided to save computing resources.
%
Development an adaptive strategy for the distance factor should involve a more stable algorithm.
%
Explore the possibility of implement a local search scheme with two goals, save function evaluations and tackle the current multi-modal problem.
%
Applying our proposal to real-world problems should be an interesting topic.
%
Based in several analyzes the mutation factor could be selected inside the distance factor, then explorate a strategy where this parameter is no required.
%
Generate a teorical model to select the adequatly population size given a initial distance factor.
