Run the code as follows:
------------------------

1- Run Test_GDG on your function to extract groups' information (Groups information for the CEC14 and CEC15 benchmarks are already included in the .zip file).

2- Run CCLSHADE to solve your function based on the extracted groups' information.



Comments:

1- The codes for GDG are downloaded from:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45783-the-cc-gdg-cmaes-algorithm
and then modified to work with the CEC14 and CEC15 benchmarks.

2- The codes for LSHADE are downloaded from:
