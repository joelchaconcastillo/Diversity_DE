In the last decade, DE has been recognized as one of the most eficient and simple algorithm.
%
Particularly, the algorithms derivated from DE have obtained one of the top rank in the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).
%
In this work we are interested in the bias of DE algorithms and CEC competitions problems througth the last years.
%
It is important to take into account that althougth the kind of problems have changed, the DE are in the top rank.
%
However, in last years exist a tendency of the EAs, most of them considers the criteria stop as part of the adaptive mechanism (e.g. decreasing population size), and are derived as a mixture of several EA approaches (e.g. DE and Covariance Matrix Adaptation).

Some of the CEC competitions are described as follows:
